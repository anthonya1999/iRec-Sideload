### Installation  
  
To install, just install Xcode 7+, create a developer account (which is now free), select a Team ID, and deploy as any other normal app! This is a slightly older version, but working and has very minor changes compared to v1.2.3, which I never actually released. Enjoy!

#Note: This does not currently work with iOS 9+
